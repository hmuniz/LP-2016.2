* Enunciado

Simpson's Rule is a more accurate method of numerical integration than
the method illustrated above. Using Simpson's Rule, the integral of a
function f between a and b is approximated as

$(H/3)[Yo+4Y1+2Y2+...+2Yn-2+4Yn-1+Yn]$

where $h = (b - a)/n$, for some even integer $n$, and $yk = f(a +
kh)$. (Increasing n increases the accuracy of the approximation.)
Define a procedure that takes as arguments f, a, b, and n and returns
the value of the integral, computed using Simpson's Rule. Use your
procedure to integrate cube between 0 and 1 (with n = 100 and n =
1000), and compare the results to those of the integral procedure
shown above.
